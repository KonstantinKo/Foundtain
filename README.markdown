# Foundtain - An Open Source Co-Founder Finder Website #

This project is intended as an open source project website that enables future 
entrepreneurs to find each other and colaborate on founding a business.

There are a few of those websites already out there, but let's create 
something a little different.

With foundtian the idea is to create a website based on profiles of founders 
and not on craigslist style classifieds like the current major players, like

+ techcofounder.com
(there it's 99$ to post a classified ad. We will create a free site. There are 
enough other places to spend your money when founding a business.)

+ findmycofounder.com
(Classifieds, limited readability and only sortable by location. We can do 
better than that.)

+ matchfounders.com
(What do you know, a profile based page. But it got "abandoned" and "buggy" 
written all over it.)



## The Mission ##

So our mission will be:

- Create a FREE hub for founders

- Put the emphasis on the PERSON (i.e. profile). We all know it's people who  
make or break businesses, not ideas.

- Let people show what they've got to offer (That's what we want to know when  
looking for a cofounder, right?) and what they are looking for.

- The "looking for" section will kind of act like the currently popular  
classifieds and will also be searchable seperately

- Let's enable everyone to search around, but require people to sign up (for  
free) for the site to view profiles. That way we grow the database of  
founders.

- Nowadays we want instant gratification. That's why the founder search will  
be AJAX based and the site will have private messages with instant popups  
(maybe even desktop popups if you stayed logged in) and a live chat with all  
founders who are online.
